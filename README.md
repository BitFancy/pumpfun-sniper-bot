# Pump.fun Sniper Bot

## 🚀 Introduction
This is an advanced Pump.fun sniper bot designed to automatically detect and execute trades on new token launches on the Solana blockchain. The bot monitors Pump.fun for newly listed tokens and executes lightning-fast buys before price surges.

## 📌 Features
- ✅ **Real-time token launch detection** on Pump.fun
- ✅ **Instant buy execution** with low-latency Solana transactions
- ✅ **Customizable snipe settings** (amount, slippage, gas priority, etc.)
- ✅ **Auto-sell feature** to secure profits
- ✅ **Wallet integration** with Phantom or Sollet

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The bot continuously scans Pump.fun for newly listed tokens.
2. It evaluates liquidity and token contract details to filter out potential scams.
3. Upon detecting a valid opportunity, it instantly executes a buy transaction.
4. If auto-sell is enabled, it will sell the token at a predefined profit target.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (or Python if the bot is written in Python)
- Solana CLI
- Phantom or Sollet wallet
- RPC node access (e.g., QuickNode, Alchemy, or public Solana RPCs)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bitfancy/pumpfun-sniper-bot.git
   cd pumpfun-sniper-bot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt if using Python
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY="your_wallet_private_key"
   RPC_URL="your_solana_rpc_url"
   ```
4. Run the bot:
   ```sh
   npm start  # or python bot.py if using Python
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration
You can customize the bot's behavior using a configuration file (`config.json` or `.env` variables). Key parameters include:
- **Buy amount**: Amount to invest per trade
- **Slippage tolerance**: Maximum acceptable price slippage
- **Auto-sell strategy**: Set take-profit and stop-loss thresholds
- **Gas priority**: Adjust transaction speed priority

## ⚠️ Risks & Considerations
- **High volatility**: Newly launched tokens can be extremely volatile.
- **Scam risk**: Some projects may have rug-pull mechanisms.
- **Transaction failures**: Network congestion or RPC issues may cause failed transactions.
- **Security**: Never expose your private keys. Use environment variables for sensitive information.
